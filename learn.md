By creating a Sense-HAT datalogger with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to collect data from multiple sensors and build it into a list structure.
- To write and append data to a text file from within a Python program.
- To capture and respond to input from the Sense HAT joystick.
- About using threads to allow multiple parts of a program to run at once.
