## Challenge: selecting the data to be recorded

You might not always want to record all the sensor data. One solution to this is to simply comment out the lines you don't need in your `get_sense_data()` function.

Another solution would be to use **conditional selection**.

Can you set up your script so that you pass into your `get_sense_data` function the sensors you want to use, and these are then the only ones that are recorded? Don't forget to add a method to alter the header row of your CSV file as well.
